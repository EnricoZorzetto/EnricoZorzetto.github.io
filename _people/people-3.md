Project: Improving the physical realism of snow processes in the U.S. Department of Energy Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). Objective of this project is improving the representation of snow aging, and its implication for simulating the evolution of snow albedo. By improving the snow energy balance in this land model, we aim to improbe prediction of water resources over mountainous regions worldwide.
